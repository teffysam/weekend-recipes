+ 1/2 kg Jeera Samba rice
+ 1 kg Lamb ribs
+ 1/2 kg onions

+ 2 tbsp vegetable oil
+ 2 nos Bay Leaf
+ 1/3 tbsp Cumin Seeds
+ 2 blades of Mace
+ 1 inch Cinnamon Stick
+ 4 Cloves

The lamb used is of particular importance to this recipe. You want Lamb ribs, as they have the perfect ratio of bone to fat to meat. When meat cooks on the bone, the fat which renders along with it keeps it moist throught the whole cook time. This leads to meat which just melts off the bone. 

Marinate the meat with curd, turmeric, the biriyani masala(I'm not so fussy about what you use here, the main flavouring comes from the onions, meat and rice), mint, fresh coriander, pepper, salt, a little bit of coriander and jeera powder and a little bit of chilli powder (optional). Let it sit for 1 hour at least. Thoroughly wash the rice and soak for 1 hour.

Finely chop white onions into slices. On a low flame, add the raw spices first and then cook onions till the colour is about golden brown. This will take a while, probably 45-60 min. [NOTE:Cooking them on a high flame will make it golden faster but this is *not* the flavour profile we are aiming for.]

I used a wide (Ikea?) pan/container. I believe the depth and surface area of the pan are factors which affect the feel of the rice. E.g. a taller container with a smaller radius base could lead to steamed rice and a burnt bottom. A wider container that is shorter led to better results in my case.

Add in the marinated meat and green chillies to the browned onions and cook for 30 min or till a lot of water is released. 

The washed rice can now be added on top and salted (carefully). When stirring, be careful *not* to bring any rice to the bottom of the container. The idea is to have the rice on the top layer and *after* it's cooked, mix the whole thing. This way the rice cooks evenly and we can avoid having mushy rice at the bottom.

Once the washed rice is added, check the water level. I added by eye, water level i approximately one knuckle above rice. Imagine keeping your hand flat on the rice and water just over the top of your middle finger knuckle. Cook on a lesser than medium flame/heat setting. Cover with a lid (doesn't need to be a tight cover) and cook till water is absorbed. Now we Dum the damn thing. Take some aluminium foil and keep it under the lid and jam the lid shut. This should provide a sufficient seal. Lower the flame to the lowest setting and leave it for 30-45 minutes. You'll know your Dum was successul when you take the foil off and it looks a bit darker than usual on the inside of the foil (weird but it works).

This resulted in the best and most fragrant jeera samba biriyani I ever made and I felt I HAD to document it for you guys.
